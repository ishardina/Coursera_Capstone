## The capstone project of utilizing Folium and Foursquare APIs 
## for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

I followed IBM Data Science Professional Certificate in Coursera, it’s composed of 9 courses in this professional certificate. There are pretty good examples of the courses.
The final assignment is to finish a project called the Capstone project which requests you to leverage Foursquare APIs to fetch the data from API calls and utilize the folium map library to visualize data analysis. It’s quite a good opportunity to practice data science methodology and toolset in this project.
